# Secret Trees Tasks

This directory contains task-specific scripts, notes, and files for the Secret Trees project.

## Important Note

**Please reference the comprehensive development guidelines in `/docs/secrettrees.mdc` for full project development standards and processes.**

## Purpose

The `tasks` directory serves as a workspace for ongoing development tasks and short-term execution scripts. Files here typically represent:

1. Individual development tasks
2. Scripts for one-time processes
3. Notes related to specific project tasks
4. Temporary files needed during development

## Task Management

All tasks must be tracked in the official task backlog:
- Main task backlog: `/docs/markdown/tasks-backlog.md`
- Project tracking: `/docs/Team/TaskTrackingSystem.md`

## Usage Guidelines

- Create a subdirectory for each major task (e.g., `tasks/openai-migration/`)
- Use descriptive file names that indicate the task purpose
- Move completed task files to their permanent locations when done
- Add a brief README in each task subdirectory

## Current Tasks

*Note: Add your current tasks here as you create them*

| Task | Description | Status | Location |
|------|-------------|--------|----------|
| Example Task | Description of what this task is about | In Progress | `tasks/example-task/` |

## Task Template

For each new task, consider creating a structure like:

```
tasks/
└── task-name/
    ├── README.md          # Task description and status
    ├── scripts/           # Task-specific scripts
    ├── notes.md           # Working notes
    └── resources/         # Related resources
```

## Cleanup

This is a working directory. Clean it regularly by:
1. Moving completed work to proper project locations
2. Archiving or deleting obsolete tasks
3. Updating this README with current tasks
