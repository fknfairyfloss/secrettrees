*Update by: Technical Architect*

## Today's Progress
- Researched carbon sequestration rates for hempcrete
- Started planning architecture for carbon calculator
- Reviewed technological requirements for blockchain integration

## Tasks Completed
- [x] Literature review on carbon sequestration in building materials
- [x] Created database schema for carbon tracking
- [ ] Still working on carbon calculator formulas

## Ongoing Tasks
- [ ] Develop carbon sequestration calculator
- [ ] Design blockchain verification mechanism
- [ ] Create API for carbon data integration

## Blockers / Help Needed
- Need more detailed specifications on hempcrete composition from Construction Lead
- Require research data on local hemp varieties' carbon sequestration rates

## Tomorrow's Plan
