# Carbon Methodology & Sequestration

## Scientific Basis

Hemp-lime (hempcrete) sequesters CO₂ through two primary mechanisms:

- **Biogenic Capture**: During growth, industrial hemp absorbs 8–15 tonnes of CO₂/ha via photosynthesis
- **Mineralization**: Lime binder absorbs atmospheric CO₂ as it cures (carbonation process)

Together, these enable Secret Trees cottages to sequester ~20 tonnes CO₂ per 25m² unit, stored for 50–100+ years.

## Measurement & Verification Methodology

The Secret Trees verification methodology aligns with:

- Verra VCS & Gold Standard methodologies
- ISO 14064-2 for project-level GHG emissions reduction
- EU Taxonomy technical screening criteria for climate mitigation

### Core Measurement Phases:

#### Biomass Calculation:
- Source documentation from hemp suppliers
- Satellite/GIS verification of hemp growth area

#### Material Quantification:
- Accurate logs of hemp hurd & lime per unit
- Material moisture and quality testing

#### Construction Tracking:
- Time-stamped construction logs
- Live environmental sensors embedded in walls

#### Post-Build Carbon Model:
- Life cycle analysis (LCA) using carbon accounting software (e.g., OneClick LCA)
- Conservative baselining with buffer pool

#### 3rd-Party Verification:
- Independent review + Ricardian contract with verifier
- Digital verification record uploaded to blockchain

## Material-Specific Carbon Values (approximate)

| Material | Sequestration Rate | Unit | Source |
|----------|-------------------|------|--------|
| Hemp Hurd | 1.62 kg CO₂e / kg | kg | peer-reviewed studies |
| Lime Binder (NHL 3.5) | -0.10 to -0.20 kg CO₂e / kg (net) | kg | LCA assessments |
| Timber Frame | ~1.8 kg CO₂e / kg | kg | FSC-certified datasets |

> Note: Sequestration values reflect cradle-to-gate emissions minus biogenic uptake and carbonation. Secret Trees uses EU-sourced, certified materials to ensure compliance.

## Integration with Tokenization

Every verified sequestration batch is:

- Logged and hashed via the Secret Trees digital backend
- Anchored to a smart contract on Polygon
- Represented via an ERC-1155 token
- Linked to an IPFS-hosted Ricardian contract

Token = 1 tonne CO₂e (verified)
Tokens can be held, traded, or retired
Each token includes metadata (project ID, verifier, date, GPS, sequestration method)

## Regulatory Alignment

- **EU ETS**: Not currently eligible for compliance market, but voluntary credits align with ETS price signals
- **EU Taxonomy**: Qualifies under climate mitigation category
- **MiCA Regulation**: Token is classified as a utility token (not financial security)
- **SFDR**: Suitable for disclosure under Articles 8 & 9 of the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation

## Transparency Tools

Secret Trees will maintain:

- Public ledger of all verification events
- Explorer for retired vs. active tokens
- Open-source data pipeline (pending)
- Public-facing verification dashboard
