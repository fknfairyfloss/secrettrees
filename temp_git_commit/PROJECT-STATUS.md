# Secret Trees: Project Status Update

> [!note] Public Information
> This document provides a high-level overview of the Secret Trees project status for interested parties, investors, and the public.

## Project Overview

Secret Trees is an innovative eco-tourism and carbon tokenization project in Latvia that combines:

1. **Sustainable Hemp Cultivation** - Carbon sequestration through hemp farming
2. **Carbon Credit Tokenization** - Blockchain-based verification and trading
3. **Eco-Tourism Experiences** - Immersive sustainability education
4. **Transparent Impact Tracking** - Real-time monitoring of carbon metrics

## Featured Property: Secret Trees Gardens

Our project is based at a 14-hectare property in Latvia divided across three development zones:
- **Zone 1**: Main cottage development and visitor center (5.3 hectares)
- **Zone 2**: Sustainable agriculture demonstration area (4.2 hectares)
- **Zone 3**: Forest conservation and biodiversity zone (4.5 hectares)

This property will showcase our full sustainability model - from hemp cultivation to carbon-sequestering construction, immersive eco-tourism experiences, and biodiversity conservation.

## Current Development Phase

**Current Phase: Foundation & Enhancement (April 2025)**

We have completed the Foundation phase and are currently in the Enhancement phase of our project development:

- âœ… **Phase 1: Foundation** - Core infrastructure setup, initial team formation, and concept validation
- ðŸ”„ **Phase 2: Enhancement** - Building automation systems, refining carbon methodology, and developing tokenization strategy
- ðŸ”œ **Phase 3: Scaling** - Expanding sustainable operations, launching token platform, and opening eco-tourism facilities

## Key Milestones Achieved

1. **Technical Platform Development**
   - Implemented knowledge management system with security tiers
   - Deployed automation workflows for project documentation and tracking
   - Established real-time carbon metric monitoring system

2. **Carbon Methodology Validation**
   - Adopted Verified Carbon Standard (VCS) methodology for hemp cultivation
   - Created measurement and verification framework
   - Established baseline carbon sequestration metrics

3. **Business Infrastructure**
   - Completed legal entity formation
   - Secured initial land agreements
   - Established partnerships with key stakeholders

4. **Land Planning**
