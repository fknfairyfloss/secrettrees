1. **Avalanche**: Secondary option with similar benefits to Polygon
2. **Hedera**: Alternative if regulatory considerations become paramount
3. **Ethereum Layer 2**: Potential future migration path if needed

## 4. Token Design and Specifications

### 4.1 Token Classification

The Secret Trees carbon token is designed as a **utility token** that represents:

1. A verified unit of carbon sequestration (typically 1 token = 1 tonne CO₂e)
2. The right to claim the environmental benefit of that sequestration
3. The ability to transfer or retire that claim

The token explicitly does **not** represent:
- Ownership stake in Secret Trees or its properties
- Right to profits or revenue from Secret Trees
- Investment in a common enterprise with expectation of profits

### 4.2 Token Standard

The token will implement the **ERC-1155** standard, which provides:

1. **Batch Operations**: Efficient handling of multiple tokens in single transactions
2. **Metadata Support**: Rich information about each token's attributes
3. **Semi-Fungibility**: Ability to have both fungible and non-fungible characteristics
4. **Gas Efficiency**: Lower transaction costs compared to separate ERC-20 tokens

### 4.3 Token Metadata Structure

Each token contains the following metadata:

```json
{
  "name": "Secret Trees Carbon Credit",
  "description": "Represents 1 tonne of CO2 sequestered in hemp construction",
  "image": "https://ipfs.secrettrees.io/token/carbon_credit.png",
  "properties": {
    "vintage": "2025-Q3",
    "projectId": "ST-HC-001",
    "buildingId": "DEMO-COTTAGE-01",
    "sequestrationMethod": "Hemp-Lime Construction",
    "verificationBody": "Carbon Verification Ltd",
    "verificationDate": "2025-09-15",
    "verificationReport": "https://ipfs.secrettrees.io/verification/ST-HC-001-2025-Q3.pdf",
    "ricardianContract": "https://ipfs.secrettrees.io/contracts/ST-HC-001-2025-Q3.pdf",
    "geolocation": {
      "latitude": "56.946285",
      "longitude": "24.105078"
    },
    "permanenceRating": "100-year",
    "additionalCertifications": ["Verra-Compatible", "Gold Standard-Compatible"],
    "retirementStatus": "Active"
  }
}
```

### 4.4 Token Lifecycle States

1. **Pending**: Carbon sequestration verified but token not yet minted
2. **Active**: Token minted and available for transfer
3. **Retired**: Token permanently retired to claim environmental benefit
4. **Suspended**: Token temporarily suspended due to verification issues
5. **Invalidated**: Token permanently invalidated due to reversal or error

### 4.5 Token Supply Mechanics

1. **Minting**: New tokens are minted only when carbon sequestration is verified
2. **Supply Cap**: Total supply limited by physical carbon sequestration capacity
3. **Burning**: Tokens are burned when retired or invalidated
4. **Batching**: Tokens are minted in batches corresponding to verification events

## 5. Smart Contract Architecture

## 11. Governance and Upgradeability

### 11.1 Governance Model

The governance of the Secret Trees carbon tokenization system follows a phased approach:

**Initial Phase (Months 1-12)**:
- Centralized governance by Secret Trees team
- Advisory input from key stakeholders
- Transparent decision-making process
- Focus on system stability and security

**Transition Phase (Months 13-24)**:
- Introduction of multi-signature requirements
- Formation of governance committee
- Inclusion of external advisors
- Gradual decentralization of key decisions

**Mature Phase (Month 25+)**:
- Decentralized governance mechanism
- Token holder voting on major decisions
- Transparent proposal and voting process
- Balanced representation of all stakeholders

### 11.2 Governance Scope

The governance system covers these decision areas:

1. **Technical Upgrades**: Changes to smart contracts and system architecture
2. **Parameter Updates**: Adjustments to system parameters and thresholds
3. **Feature Additions**: New functionality and capabilities
4. **Policy Changes**: Updates to rules and policies
5. **Emergency Response**: Actions in response to critical issues

### 11.3 Smart Contract Upgradeability

The system implements a carefully designed upgradeability approach:

**Proxy Pattern Implementation**:
- Transparent proxy pattern for core contracts
- Separation of storage and logic
- Immutable proxy addresses with upgradeable implementation

**Upgrade Process**:
1. New implementation contract deployment
2. Thorough testing in staging environment
3. Governance approval through multi-signature or voting
4. Time-locked execution of upgrade
5. Verification of successful upgrade

**Upgrade Limitations**:
- Storage layout preservation requirements
- Function selector stability
- Backwards compatibility requirements
- Critical function immutability

**Emergency Upgrades**:
- Defined criteria for emergency situations
- Expedited approval process with post-upgrade review
- Circuit breaker functionality for critical issues
- Transparent communication requirements

### 11.4 Transparency and Communication

All governance activities follow strict transparency requirements:

1. **Proposal Publication**: All upgrade proposals publicly available
2. **Discussion Period**: Minimum timeframe for community discussion
3. **Decision Documentation**: Clear documentation of all decisions
4. **Change Logs**: Detailed logs of all system changes
5. **Audit Reports**: Public availability of all audit reports
6. **Incident Disclosure**: Transparent disclosure of any incidents

## 12. Regulatory Considerations

### 12.1 Token Classification Analysis

The Secret Trees carbon token is designed as a utility token based on these characteristics:

1. **Primary Purpose**: Representation of verified carbon sequestration utility
2. **Functionality**: Enables claiming of environmental benefit
3. **Value Derivation**: Value derived from underlying environmental benefit, not project profits
4. **Marketing Approach**: Marketed as environmental tool, not investment
5. **Token Distribution**: Distribution based on verified carbon sequestration, not investment raising

This classification is supported by:
- Focus on carbon credit functionality
- Absence of profit-sharing or revenue rights
- Direct connection to physical carbon sequestration
- Alignment with existing carbon credit frameworks

### 12.2 Jurisdictional Analysis

**European Union**:
- Alignment with MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets) regulation
- Compliance with EU Taxonomy for sustainable activities
- Consideration of Digital Finance Package requirements
- Monitoring of EU Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism

**Latvia**:
- Compliance with national cryptocurrency regulations
- Alignment with Latvian Financial and Capital Market Commission guidance
- Consideration of national carbon accounting requirements
- Engagement with Latvian regulatory authorities

**Global Considerations**:
- Monitoring of FATF (Financial Action Task Force) guidance
- Awareness of major jurisdiction requirements for potential expansion
- Alignment with international carbon market standards
- Consideration of cross-border transaction requirements

### 12.3 Compliance Implementation

**Know Your Customer (KYC)**:
- Risk-based KYC approach
- Tiered KYC requirements based on transaction volume
- Integration with identity verification providers
- Secure storage of KYC information

**Anti-Money Laundering (AML)**:
- Transaction monitoring system
- Suspicious activity reporting process
- Risk assessment framework
- Staff training program

**Tax Reporting**:
- Transaction record maintenance
- Reporting capability for relevant jurisdictions
- Tax documentation for users
- Consultation with tax authorities

**Carbon Market Compliance**:
- Alignment with carbon credit issuance requirements
- Double-counting prevention mechanisms
- Retirement verification and documentation
- Compliance with offset claim requirements

### 12.4 Regulatory Engagement Strategy

**Proactive Approach**:
- Early engagement with relevant regulators
- Participation in regulatory sandboxes where available
- Contribution to industry standards development
- Regular regulatory landscape monitoring

**Documentation and Disclosure**:
- Comprehensive legal opinions
- Clear terms of service and user agreements
- Transparent token classification documentation
- Regular compliance reviews and updates

**Adaptation Capability**:
- Flexible system design for regulatory changes
- Upgrade paths for compliance requirements
- Regulatory change monitoring system
- Compliance advisory committee

## 14. Conclusion

This comprehensive blockchain implementation plan provides a complete technical framework for tokenizing carbon credits generated through hemp construction in the Secret Trees project. By focusing on utility tokens that represent verified carbon sequestration from Ricardian contracts, the system avoids regulatory complexities while maintaining the core value proposition.

The implementation leverages the Polygon blockchain for its energy efficiency, low transaction costs, and compatibility with the Ethereum ecosystem. The ERC-1155 token standard provides the flexibility needed for carbon credits with rich metadata and efficient operations.

The smart contract architecture separates concerns into Registry, Token, Verification, Marketplace, and Retirement contracts, creating a modular and upgradeable system. The Ricardian contract integration ensures legal enforceability by linking physical assets, digital tokens, and legal terms in both human-readable and machine-readable formats.

The user interface design focuses on simplicity and accessibility for different user types, from project developers to token buyers. Security and risk management are addressed through comprehensive threat modeling and mitigation strategies.

Integration with traditional carbon markets is achieved through standards alignment, registry integration, marketplace connectivity, and bridges between traditional and tokenized systems. The implementation roadmap provides a clear path from foundation to scaling over an 18-month period.

By implementing this blockchain system, Secret Trees will create a transparent, verifiable, and efficient mechanism for tracking and trading the carbon sequestration benefits of hemp construction, pioneering a new approach to building-based carbon credits that can scale globally.
