### 3.4 Hemp Partner FAQ

**Q: What quality of hemp is required for construction?**
A: Construction-grade hemp requires consistent fiber length, low dust content, and proper processing to remove woody core (shiv) for use in hemp-lime mixtures. We can provide detailed specifications and work with partners to achieve optimal quality.

**Q: How is pricing determined for construction-grade hemp?**
A: Pricing is based on quality metrics including fiber consistency, dust content, and processing quality. Premium construction-grade hemp typically commands 15-25% higher prices than industrial hemp for other applications.

**Q: What volumes will Secret Trees require?**
A: Our initial demonstration cottage requires approximately 5 tonnes of processed hemp. The full eco-tourism destination will require 50+ tonnes, with demand scaling over a 36-month development timeline.

**Q: Can existing hemp processing equipment be used?**
A: Most standard decorticating equipment can be adapted for construction-grade hemp processing with minor modifications. We can provide guidance on optimal processing techniques for construction applications.

**Q: Is organic certification required?**
A: While not strictly required, organic or low-chemical cultivation is preferred for optimal indoor air quality in finished buildings. We can work with partners on appropriate cultivation methods.

**Q: How can hemp farmers participate in carbon credits?**
A: Our carbon sequestration methodology includes both the carbon captured during cultivation and that stored in the building materials. We're developing a system to track and tokenize this carbon, with participation opportunities for supply chain partners.

### 5.4 Technology Partner FAQ

**Q: What carbon measurement methodology is Secret Trees using?**
A: We're developing a methodology based on established carbon accounting principles that quantifies both the biogenic carbon in hemp materials and the carbon avoided through displacement of conventional materials. We're seeking partners to refine and validate this methodology.

**Q: How is the carbon verification conducted?**
A: Verification involves material testing, quantity documentation, and ongoing monitoring. We're developing a system that combines physical testing with digital tracking to create auditable carbon sequestration claims.

**Q: What blockchain platform is preferred?**
A: We're blockchain-agnostic but prioritize platforms with low environmental impact, strong security, and compatibility with carbon markets. We're open to recommendations from technology partners based on specific requirements.

**Q: What types of sensors and IoT systems are needed?**
A: We require sensors for monitoring moisture content, temperature, and structural integrity to verify the ongoing carbon storage. These need to be durable, low-maintenance, and capable of long-term deployment in building materials.

**Q: How will the tokenization system work?**
A: We envision tokenizing both the carbon credits and potentially fractional ownership of the properties. Each token would represent a verified quantity of sequestered carbon with appropriate metadata and verification documentation.

**Q: What data integration challenges do you anticipate?**
A: Key challenges include connecting physical measurements with digital records, ensuring data integrity throughout the building lifecycle, and creating interoperability with existing carbon markets and verification systems.
