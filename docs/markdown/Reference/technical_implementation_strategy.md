# Secret Trees Technical Implementation Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the technical implementation strategy for the Secret Trees digital platform, building upon the comprehensive specifications provided in the Manus AI research package. It focuses on practical implementation decisions regarding UI framework, documentation management, and development workflow to accelerate development while maintaining quality and scalability.

## Key Technical Decisions

### 1. UI Framework: Shadcn UI with Next.js

#### Decision Overview
We will implement the Secret Trees digital platform using Shadcn UI components within our Next.js framework. This approach aligns with the platform specifications while providing additional benefits for rapid development.

#### Integration with Digital Platform Specifications
The digital platform specifications document (Section 5.1) outlines a frontend framework based on Next.js, React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. Shadcn UI directly enhances this stack:

- Built specifically for Next.js applications
- Uses Tailwind CSS for styling, maintaining the specified styling approach
- Provides accessible, customizable components that follow web standards
- Helps accelerate development of the interface components described in Section 3.4

#### Implementation Plan
1. **Initial Setup (Week 1)**
   - Initialize Shadcn UI in the Next.js project using `npx shadcn-ui@latest init`
   - Configure theme to match Secret Trees brand colors specified in Section 3.2.1
   - Set up component organization structure

2. **Component Development (Weeks 2-3)**
   - Implement core UI components prioritizing those needed for the homepage and core pages
   - Customize Shadcn components to match the biophilic design philosophy outlined in Section 3.1
   - Document component usage and customization patterns

3. **Page Assembly (Weeks 4-6)**
   - Build homepage and priority pages using the Shadcn component library
   - Implement responsive layouts following the specifications in Section 3.4
   - Ensure accessibility compliance as outlined in Section 10.3.1

### 2. Documentation Management: Obsidian

#### Decision Overview
We will use Obsidian as our internal documentation and planning tool before migrating to more public-facing solutions. This approach provides a Git-friendly, privacy-focused solution for early development while maintaining traceability.

#### Integration with Existing Documentation
Obsidian will be structured to organize and extend the comprehensive documentation already provided in the Manus AI research package:

- Preserve the categorization outlined in the index.md document
- Enable linking between related documents
- Support version control and change tracking
- Facilitate team collaboration while maintaining privacy

#### Implementation Plan
1. **Vault Structure Setup (Week 1)**
   - Create Obsidian vault in the project repository
   - Migrate key Manus AI research documents 
   - Establish structure for:
     - `/tasks` - Current sprint/development tasks
     - `/specs` - Technical specifications (including existing documentation)
     - `/research` - Carbon verification research notes
     - `/meetings` - Meeting notes and decisions
     - `/templates` - Reusable documentation templates

2. **Development Tracking Setup (Week 1-2)**
   - Implement task tracking using Obsidian Kanban plugin
   - Create templates for:
     - Sprint planning
     - Technical decision records
     - Meeting notes
     - Implementation guides

3. **Workflow Integration (Ongoing)**
   - Document all technical decisions using standardized templates
   - Track development progress against the 90-day plan
   - Maintain a single source of truth for project documentation
   - Plan migration path to public tools (such as Notion) as project matures

### 3. CI/CD Pipeline Architecture

#### Decision Overview
We will implement a CI/CD pipeline based on GitHub Actions to automate our development workflow, aligning with the infrastructure goals outlined in the project status document.

#### Integration with Digital Platform Specifications
The CI/CD implementation directly supports the infrastructure requirements specified in Section 5.1.8 of the digital platform specifications:

- Cloud-native deployment
- Containerization with Docker
- Automated deployment
- Testing and quality assurance

#### Implementation Plan

1. **Initial Setup (Week 1-2)**
   - Configure GitHub repository structure
   - Set up development, staging, and production environments
   - Implement basic GitHub Actions workflow for linting and testing

2. **Build Pipeline (Week 3)**
   - Implement automated build process
   - Configure environment-specific builds
   - Set up dependency caching for faster builds
   - Implement type checking and code quality analysis

3. **Testing Pipeline (Week 4)**
   - Configure automated unit testing with Jest
   - Implement component testing for Shadcn UI components
   - Set up end-to-end testing for critical user flows
   - Configure test coverage reporting

4. **Deployment Pipeline (Week 4-5)**
   - Set up automated deployment to staging environment
   - Configure preview deployments for pull requests
   - Implement production deployment workflow with manual approval
   - Set up rollback mechanisms

5. **Monitoring and Feedback (Week 6+)**
   - Implement build and deployment notifications
   - Configure performance monitoring
   - Set up error tracking and reporting
   - Establish continuous improvement process

## Alignment with 90-Day Action Plan

This technical implementation strategy has been designed to align with and enhance the 90-Day Action Plan outlined in the executive summary document:

### Phase 1: Foundation Building (Days 1-30)
- UI Framework (Shadcn UI) setup aligns with "Digital Presence Establishment" in Week 2
- Obsidian setup supports documentation needs throughout Phase 1
- CI/CD pipeline initial setup provides foundation for website enhancement with Builder.io

### Phase 2: Engagement & Development (Days 31-60)
- Complete UI implementation supports "Content Development & Community Building" in Week 8
- CI/CD deployment pipeline enables rapid iteration for investor meetings in Week 6
- Obsidian documentation structure supports partner engagement activities

### Phase 3: Implementation & Scaling (Days 61-90)
- Full CI/CD pipeline enables "Digital Platform Development" in Week 11
- Shadcn UI components will accelerate development of carbon tracking interfaces
- Obsidian documentation will support the "Expansion Planning & Review" in Week 12

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Actions (Next 24-48 Hours)**
   - Set up Next.js project repository with Shadcn UI
   - Initialize Obsidian vault with basic structure
   - Configure initial GitHub Actions workflow

2. **Week 1 Priorities**
   - Complete Obsidian documentation migration
   - Configure Shadcn UI theme to match Secret Trees branding
   - Develop component implementation plan aligned with homepage requirements

3. **Decision Points**
   - Finalize hosting platform selection based on budget constraints
   - Determine staging environment configuration
   - Select monitoring and analytics tools

This technical implementation strategy provides the practical framework needed to execute the digital platform specifications while maximizing development efficiency and quality. By leveraging modern tools like Shadcn UI, Obsidian, and GitHub Actions, we can accelerate the development timeline while maintaining the comprehensive vision outlined in the Manus AI research package.
