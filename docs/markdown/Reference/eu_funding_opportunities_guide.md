## 11. Conclusion

This EU Funding Opportunities Guide provides a comprehensive roadmap for securing funding for the Secret Trees project, from the initial €28,000 needed for the demonstration cottage to the full €3,155,000 development. By following the strategic approach outlined in this guide and utilizing the templates and resources provided, Secret Trees can maximize its funding success probability.

The key to success will be a staged approach that begins with national funding sources like the LIAA Innovation Voucher and Rural Support Service, followed by targeted applications to EU-level programs aligned with specific project components. Strategic partnerships with research institutions, industry players, and public authorities will strengthen applications and open doors to consortium-based funding opportunities.

By diversifying funding sources, emphasizing different project aspects for different programs, and maintaining meticulous compliance with application requirements, Secret Trees can build a sustainable funding mix that supports its vision of pioneering hemp construction with integrated carbon sequestration tracking and tokenization.

The immediate action plan provides concrete steps to begin the funding journey, focusing on the most accessible and aligned opportunities first while laying groundwork for larger funding applications. By implementing this plan, Secret Trees can secure the initial funding needed to demonstrate its innovative approach and create the foundation for full-scale implementation.
