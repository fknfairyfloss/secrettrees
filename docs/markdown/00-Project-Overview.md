# Secret Trees Project Overview

Secret Trees is an eco-tourism project in Latvia's Saldus region, combining hempcrete-based carbon sequestration, blockchain tokenization, and sustainable tourism.

## Mission

To build the future of sustainable living through:
- Eco-tourism experiences rooted in Latvian natural heritage
- Hempcrete-based construction that sequesters carbon
- Community-anchored development with local partnerships
- Blockchain-backed environmental verification and tokenization

## Project Concept

A pioneering eco-village built on inherited forest-adjacent land, featuring:
- 20–35 small cottages (26–40 m²) made from hempcrete
- Educational and recreational experiences focused on sustainability
- Demonstration pilot unit funded by a €28,000 seed investment
- Carbon credit generation from hemp-lime sequestration
- Public access trails, bee habitats, workshops, and local crafts

## Why Latvia?

Latvia presents a unique opportunity in the Baltic region due to:
- Abundant local hemp and timber resources
- Supportive national policies for green innovation
- EU membership and access to Green Deal funding
- A growing eco-tourism sector and underutilized rural land
- Emerging municipal infrastructure (e.g., biking roads, lake tower, etc.)

## What Makes Secret Trees Unique

- Grow Your Own House Ethos: Empowering locals to participate in building eco-homes
- Blockchain for Impact: Verifiable carbon sequestration through tokenized credits
- EU-Focused Carbon Strategy: Targeting ETS + voluntary carbon market premiums
- Real Asset, Real Impact: Blending tourism, land use, and environmental accountability
