# Security Update: Token Exposure Fix

## Issue Summary

**Date Detected:** April 26, 2025
**Issue Type:** JSON Web Token exposure in GitHub repository
**Severity:** High
**Status:** Fixed

GitGuardian detected an exposed JSON Web Token in our repository. A Telegram bot token was hardcoded in the `simple-telegram-bot.js` file, presenting a security risk as it could allow unauthorized control of our Telegram bot.

## Actions Taken

1. **Token Configuration Approach**
   - Created configuration files (`config/bot-config.js`) to store sensitive tokens
   - Updated `.gitignore` to exclude these configuration files from git
   - Refactored scripts to load tokens from configuration files

2. **GitHub Integration Script Fixes**
   - Updated the GitHub integration script to properly handle tokens securely
   - Improved error handling throughout the script
   - Added detailed logging for better troubleshooting

3. **n8n Workflow Updates**
   - Created new secure workflow version that loads credentials safely
   - Updated workflow to use Node.js commands to retrieve tokens from configuration 
   - Implemented better error handling in workflow execution

## Preventative Measures

To prevent similar issues in the future:

1. **Token Management Policy**
   - Never hardcode tokens or credentials in source files
   - Always use configuration files excluded from git
   - Consider using environment variables in production

2. **CI/CD Security Checks**
   - Added GitGuardian integration to detect exposed secrets
   - Implemented pre-commit hooks to catch sensitive data

3. **Developer Guidelines**
   - Updated documentation with security best practices
   - Created templates for new services that follow secure patterns

## Verification

The changes have been tested and verified:
- Telegram bot functionality continues to work with the new approach
- GitHub integration scripts successfully generate reports
- n8n workflows execute correctly with the secured token method

## Next Steps

1. Audit remaining codebase for other potential token exposures
2. Implement automated scanning in CI pipeline
3. Conduct security training session with all team members
4. Rotate any compromised tokens
