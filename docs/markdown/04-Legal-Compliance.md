# Legal & Regulatory Compliance

## Purpose

To establish a secure, compliant, and transparent contract lifecycle that accurately verifies real-world carbon sequestration and facilitates on-chain token issuance, strictly adhering to EU legal standards.

## Token Legal Status

- **MiCA**: Utility token, not a financial security
- **EU Taxonomy**: Eligible under climate mitigation
- **SFDR**: Article 8 & 9 ESG disclosure
- **GDPR**: No personal data on-chain

## Contractual Layers

### 1. Primary Agreement (COâ‚‚ Contract)

- **Parties**: Hemp Farmer â†” Processor / Project Developer
- **Contract Details**:
  - Biomass yield estimation
  - Construction objectives and timelines
  - Verified methodology (ISO 14064 or equivalent)
  - Declared carbon retention period (typically 50â€“100 years)
- **Format**: Machine-readable and human-readable (Markdown & JSON Schema)

### 2. Verification Agreement

- **Parties**: Project Developer â†” Accredited Third-Party Verifier
- **Purpose**: Conduct site inspections or documentation audits
- **Outcome**: Verified approval documents securely hashed and stored on IPFS

### 3. Ricardian Contract

- **Function**: Legally binding document bridging off-chain contractual obligations with blockchain technology
- **Key Components**:
  - Hash of original COâ‚‚ contract
  - Verifier information
  - Methodology and mass balance documentation
  - Clear delineation of token rights and disclaimers (explicitly non-securitized token)

## Legal Positioning

- **Tokens are not securities**: No implied promise of financial returns; tokens represent proof of carbon sequestration and participation rights only.
- **No real estate implications**: Tokens do not constitute fractional ownership; instead, they function as sustainability project access tokens.
- **GDPR Compliance**: Metadata excludes personally identifiable information (PII), which is securely managed under consent-based, off-chain user ID systems.
- **EU Taxonomy Alignment**: Contracts adhere strictly to EU definitions for climate change mitigation and circular economy objectives.

## Contract Lifecycle Workflow

1. Hemp farmer submits contract to the digital platform.
2. AI-driven validation agent evaluates contract accuracy.
3. Validated contracts proceed to a designated verifier pool.
4. Accredited verifier assigned; conducts thorough review.
5. Upon approval, a Ricardian contract is automatically generated.
6. Relevant document hashes securely uploaded to IPFS.
7. Smart contract receives mint trigger along with metadata URI.
8. Verified tokens appear in the Secret Trees DAO registry.

## Non-Permanence Risk Management

### Risk Assessment
- Building lifespan estimation (minimum 100 years for permanent structures)
- Structural integrity risk factors
- Fire and disaster risk assessment
- Maintenance and ownership risk factors

### Buffer Pool Allocation
- 15% of total carbon credits allocated to buffer pool
- Buffer pool managed collectively across all Secret Trees projects
- Credits released from buffer after 50 years of verified permanence
