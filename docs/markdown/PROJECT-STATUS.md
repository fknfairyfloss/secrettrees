# Secret Trees: Project Status Update

> [!note] Public Information
> This document provides a high-level overview of the Secret Trees project status for interested parties, investors, and the public.

## Project Overview

Secret Trees is an innovative eco-tourism and carbon tokenization project in Latvia that combines:

1. **Sustainable Hemp Cultivation** - Carbon sequestration through hemp farming
2. **Carbon Credit Tokenization** - Blockchain-based verification and trading
3. **Eco-Tourism Experiences** - Immersive sustainability education
4. **Transparent Impact Tracking** - Real-time monitoring of carbon metrics

## Featured Property: Secret Trees Gardens

Our project spans multiple properties strategically located in Latvia:

- **Main Eco-Tourism Site**: 14 hectares divided across three development zones:
  - **Zone 1**: Main cottage development and visitor center (5.3 hectares)
  - **Zone 2**: Sustainable agriculture demonstration area (4.2 hectares)
  - **Zone 3**: Forest conservation and biodiversity zone (4.5 hectares)

- **Eastern Plantation**: 47.8 hectares recently surveyed for large-scale hemp cultivation
  - Soil quality analysis shows excellent suitability (pH levels: 6.2-6.8)
  - Will serve as our primary carbon sequestration farm
  - Located 25 minutes from the main eco-tourism site

These properties will showcase our full sustainability model - from hemp cultivation to carbon-sequestering construction, immersive eco-tourism experiences, and biodiversity conservation.

## Current Development Phase

**Current Phase: Foundation & Enhancement (April 2025)**

We have completed the Foundation phase and are currently in the Enhancement phase of our project development:

- ✅ **Phase 1: Foundation** - Core infrastructure setup, initial team formation, and concept validation
- 🔄 **Phase 2: Enhancement** - Building automation systems, refining carbon methodology, and developing tokenization strategy
- 🔜 **Phase 3: Scaling** - Expanding plantations, launching token platform, and opening eco-tourism facilities

## Key Milestones Achieved

1. **Technical Platform Development**
   - Implemented knowledge management system with security tiers
   - Deployed automation workflows for project documentation and tracking
   - Established real-time carbon metric monitoring system

2. **Carbon Methodology Validation**
   - Adopted Verified Carbon Standard (VCS) methodology for hemp cultivation
   - Created measurement and verification framework
   - Established baseline carbon sequestration metrics

3. **Business Infrastructure**
   - Completed legal entity formation
   - Secured initial land agreements for both eco-tourism site and eastern plantation
   - Established partnerships with key stakeholders

4. **Land Acquisition & Assessment**
   - Completed land survey of the 47.8 hectare eastern plantation
   - Secured 14 hectares for the main eco-tourism development
   - Conducted soil and environmental analysis on all properties

## Current Focus Areas

Our current work is concentrated on:

1. **Analytics Enhancement** - Building data visualization dashboards for carbon metrics
2. **Tokenization Platform** - Developing the technical infrastructure for carbon credit tokenization
3. **Automation Systems** - Creating intelligent workflows for operational efficiency
4. **Investor Documentation** - Preparing comprehensive materials for strategic partners
5. **Property Development** - Sustainable renovation of existing structures using hempcrete technology
6. **Eastern Plantation Preparation** - Preparing the 47.8 hectare site for hemp cultivation
