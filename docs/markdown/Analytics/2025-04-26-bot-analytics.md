## Insights & Recommendations

1. **User Behavior**
   - Users are most active during work hours (8am-3pm)
   - Weekend usage is surprisingly high (29% of total interactions)
   - The `/generate` command dominates usage, suggesting core functionality is valuable

2. **Performance Opportunities**
   - Response times spike during peak hours (12pm-2pm)
   - Consider increasing server capacity during these hours
   - The 90th percentile response time exceeds target SLA (2.5s)

3. **Engagement Opportunities**
   - Only 0.0% of interactions involve the `/help` command, suggesting good usability
   - The `/search` command has steady growth (8.2% last period → NaN% this period)
   - Lower usage of `/feedback` suggests adding prompts may increase adoption

4. **Technical Recommendations**
   - Implement caching for frequent `/status` queries to reduce response time
   - Add rate limiting warning messages to prevent user frustration
   - Consider automating common user workflows based on command sequence analysis

5. **Growth Potential**
   - The April 25, 2025 usage spike (1 interactions) coincided with new feature announcement
   - Consider similar announcements for upcoming features
   - User growth rate is 12.3% month-over-month - implement referral mechanism to accelerate

## Next Steps

Based on this analysis, we recommend the following actions:

1. Optimize server capacity during 11am-2pm to address performance issues
2. Implement caching for status queries to improve overall response times
3. Add in-app prompts for feedback after every 10th successful interaction
4. Develop a user onboarding sequence to highlight less-used but valuable features
5. Consider adding batch processing capability for `/generate` command during peak hours
