## Running n8n

The n8n server is currently running. To restart it if needed:

```bash
# Kill any existing n8n processes
pkill -f "n8n start"

# Start n8n with production settings
cd ~/Development
NODE_ENV=production npx n8n start
```

## Running Telegram Bot

The Telegram bot is now active. To manage it:

## Notes & Observations

The integration between n8n and Obsidian provides a powerful system for:

1. **Automated Documentation:** Changes to project data are automatically reflected in documentation
2. **Comprehensive Tracking:** All changes are timestamped and logged for full auditability
3. **API Access:** All project data and functions are accessible via simple API endpoints
4. **Intelligent Responses:** AI-powered assistants can answer questions about the project
5. **Multi-channel Communication:** Telegram bot provides user-friendly interface to project information

This foundation sets up Secret Trees for efficient operations with minimal manual documentation overhead.
