# Secret Trees - Perplexity Research Request

## Executive Summary
Secret Trees is an eco-tourism project being developed in Latvia's Saldus region that combines hempcrete construction (for carbon sequestration), blockchain tokenization of environmental benefits, and sustainable tourism. We're currently in the concept/planning phase and need factual validation of key assumptions before proceeding with implementation. This research request seeks to verify scientific, regulatory, market, and technical assumptions, not to generate additional conceptual content.

## Project Overview
Secret Trees aims to build 20-35 small hemp-based cottages that sequester carbon, tokenize this environmental benefit through blockchain, and create a regenerative tourism destination. The initial phase involves a €28,000 demonstration cottage to validate construction methods and carbon monitoring systems.

## Reference Materials - Section 2: Carbon & Hemp Construction

### 01 Carbon Methodology And Sequestration

**Scientific Basis**
Hemp-lime (hempcrete) sequesters CO₂ through two primary mechanisms:
- Biogenic Capture: During growth, industrial hemp absorbs 8–15 tonnes of CO₂/ha via photosynthesis
- Mineralization: Lime binder absorbs atmospheric CO₂ as it cures (carbonation process)
Together, these enable Secret Trees cottages to sequester ~20 tonnes CO₂ per 25m² unit, stored for 50–100+ years.

**Measurement & Verification Methodology**
The Secret Trees verification methodology aligns with:
- Verra VCS & Gold Standard methodologies
- ISO 14064-2 for project-level GHG emissions reduction
- EU Taxonomy technical screening criteria for climate mitigation

Core Measurement Phases:
- Biomass Calculation
- Material Quantification
- Construction Tracking
- Post-Build Carbon Model
- 3rd-Party Verification

**Material-Specific Carbon Values (approximate)**
- Hemp Hurd: 1.62 kg CO₂e / kg
- Lime Binder (NHL 3.5): -0.10 to -0.20 kg CO₂e / kg (net)
- Timber Frame: ~1.8 kg CO₂e / kg

**Integration with Tokenization**
Every verified sequestration batch is:
- Logged and hashed via the Secret Trees digital backend
- Anchored to a smart contract on Polygon
- Represented via an ERC-1155 token
- Linked to an IPFS-hosted Ricardian contract

**Regulatory Alignment**
- EU ETS: Not currently eligible for compliance market, but voluntary credits align with ETS price signals
- EU Taxonomy: Qualifies under climate mitigation category
- MiCA Regulation: Token is classified as a utility token (not financial security)
- SFDR: Suitable for disclosure under Articles 8 & 9 of the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation

## Reference Materials - Section 3: Blockchain & Tokenization

### 02 Blockchain Tokenization Strategy

**Token Design**
- Token Standard: ERC-1155 (Multi-token standard)
- Represents 1 tonne of verified CO₂ sequestration per token
- Batch minting linked to verification events
- Utility Token Classification

**Smart Contract Architecture**
- Platform: Polygon PoS (Ethereum Layer 2)
- Contract Logic: Manages lifecycle of carbon tokens

**Ricardian Contracts**
Each verification batch is linked to a Ricardian contract:
- Includes legal verification agreement
- Full metadata and carbon methodology
- IPFS-hosted hash linked on-chain
- Ensures legal enforceability of environmental claims

**Regulatory Compliance**
- MiCA: ✅ Aligned - Utility token, not financial security
- EU Taxonomy: ✅ Aligned - Project eligible under climate mitigation activity
- SFDR: ✅ Suitable - Tokens support Article 9 ESG disclosure
- GDPR: ✅ Enforced - No personal data stored on-chain

**Token Use Cases**
- ESG Credits: Verified carbon retirement for corporate sustainability reports
- Eco-tourism Access: Token holders get discounts or early access to Secret Trees cottages
- Governance: Participate in DAO decision-making (future roadmap)
- Impact Proof: Tokens link to dashboard showing real-time sequestration

### 09 Timeshare Utility Token Design

**Concept Overview**
Secret Trees utility tokens provide fractional eco-experience access rights rather than fractional real estate ownership. This token model avoids regulatory classification as a financial security while enabling powerful community governance, carbon participation, and regenerative tourism benefits.

**Token Functionality**
Each ERC-1155 token grants:
- DAO Voting Rights
- Eco-Timeshare Credits
- On-chain CO₂ Tracking

**Legal Model**
- Timeshare Rights: Usage credits, not ownership
- DAO Voting: Participation in initiative development, not profit-sharing
- Token Value: Non-monetary function with utility perks only
- Booking Priority: Lottery or point-based allocation, not legal guarantee

**Governance Model**
- DAO operates through proposal cycles (monthly/quarterly)
- 1 token = 1 vote (per proposal category)
- Weighted stake applies only to proposal submission privileges, not vote power
- AI agents assist in proposal summarization and vote visibility

**Fair Allocation System**
- Staking + Snapshot of token holdings
- Lottery Draw for priority time windows (tourism use)
- Point Credits for educational + governance activities
- Dynamic Burn + Replace for impact-linked benefit resets

**What It Is Not**
- Not a yield-generating instrument
- Not a real estate security or rent-yield token
- Not a speculative asset under EU securities law
